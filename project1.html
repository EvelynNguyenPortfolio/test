									<h3 class="major">Purpose</h3>
									<p>The purpose of this project was to practice employing modularity and Java IO. By practicing modularity, 
									I hope to prepare for future projects in which I need to reuse and share code with collaborators. Additionally, becoming more
									skilled with Java IO will help me better store, transfer, and manipulate data.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Description</h3>
									<p>The project's program serves as library database. Four different classes were used in this program. Class LibraryItem served as the 
									parent class to class Book, class CD, and class DVD. The objects of these classes represented instances of library items
									and were stored in an ArrayList that represented the library database. In the main file that ran the code, users are given a 
									menu in which they can choose to search an item, display items of a specific type, display all items, add an item, 
									import items, and export items. Depending on the menu option the users choose, they will be prompted
									to enter the item information or file name needed to manipulate the database. 
									</p>
									
									• searchByTitle Method <br>			
									<p>Method Description: The method prompts users to enter the name of the item they want to search.
									Using the passed value, the method goes through each object in the ArrayList libraryItems and compares the value of the object's 
									variable title to the value of the entered item name. If the title and the entered item name are the same, the method prints out the 
									object. If none of the object's titles match the enterd item name, the method prints that the item is not in the library base. </p>
									
									• displayBooks Method <br>
									<p>Method Description: The method goes through each object in the ArrayList libraryItems and checks if its class type is the same as class Book.
									If the class type is the same as class Book, the method prints out the object. </p>
									
									• displayCDs Method <br>
									<p>Method Description: The method goes through each object in the ArrayList libraryItems and checks if its class type is the same as class CD.
									If the class type is the same as class CD, the method prints out the object. </p>
									
									• displayDVDs Method <br>
									<p>Method Description: The method goes through each object in the ArrayList libraryItems and checks if its class type is the same as class DVD.
									If the class type is the same as class DVD, the method prints out the object. </p>
									
									• addNewItem Method <br>
									<p>Method Description: The method prompts users to enter what type of item they want to add. Depending on the entered item type, the 
									method prompts users to enter information about the item and passes it to the class constructor 
									matching the entered item type. This creates a new object of the entered item type and sets the value of
									its instance variables to the information passed in the constructor. After the new object is created, it is added to 
									the ArrayList libraryItems</p>
									
									• addWithFile Method <br>
									<p>Method Description: The method prompts users to enter the name of the CSV file with which they want to import items. Using Scanner and InputStream, the method
									reads the CSV file using commas as the delimiter. The first value of each file line specifies the item type and the subsequent values are passed into
									the constructor of the item type. Once the new object is created, the method adds the object to the ArrayList<LibraryItem> libraryItems.
									This process repeats until there are no more file lines.</p>
									
									• exportItemsFile Method <br>
									<p>Method Description: The method prompts users to enter the name of the CSV file with which they want to export items. Then, the method goes through each object
									in the ArrayList<LibraryItem> libraryItems. Using Scanner and OutputStream, the method appends the type of the object (item type) and the value of 
									its instance variables to a new line in the CSV file. This process repeats until the method goes through all objects in the ArrayList.</p>
									
									<h3 class="major">Challenges</h3>
									<p> One of challenges I faced was properly importing items (objects) from the CSV file. Each object had its own line on which its instance variables were written, and the values
									of its instance variables were deliminated by commas. Unfortunately, problems occurred when the users tried to import more than one object. Becuase I set the values
									to be deliminated by commas, the addWithFile method believed the last value belonging to previous object included the first value of the next object. The method did not understand that 
									the two values belonged to seperate objects. It combined the two values and the new line space seperating them (/n) into one String value. I resolved this issue by having the method
									read and store each CSV file line into a variable before reading the comma deliminated values. This ensured that each object's information was seperate from each other.
